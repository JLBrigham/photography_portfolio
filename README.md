Problems I've overcome

having problems getting email js to work- narrowed it down to 'contact service' not being a named variable. Realised that my service ID was also not anywhere in the code, added a variable with service ID and replaced the ocntact service placeholder with that, and ta dah it worked. I think I came across these probles as I was using 2 different tutorials, the offical docs and then a blog post, probably better to stick to one tutorial.
